# Professional-Portfolio

## Description

Modifiable Portfolio that gives a user friendly experience with information about myself. Currently unfinished, as I am still working with getting the alignment for my 'projects' and 'contact' sections. I also need to get this working with Mobile Devices correctly. I will continue to push updates before the due date and get this completed! I want to be able to use this for the rest of the bootcamp to store my projects for future use.

## Installation

No Steps Required for Installation

## Usage

<img src="./assets/css/images/mockup-port.png" alt="mockup-photo">

Using the Navigation Bar at the top will result in the page scrolling to the specific sections for the user.
